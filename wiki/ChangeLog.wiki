=Some time in-between Feb 1 and March 1=
Finished the tempents list, but other messages haven't been done like stuffcmd.
Items system started, take a peek in cc_items to see how I'm going to do it (pure virtual classes, woot)

Finished up scoreboard and HUDs.
Gonna go finish the tempent list while I'm at it, then branch TempEnts off into
another category for things like stuffcmd.

First real revision of CleanCode.
I made some basic systems to hopefully get the idea of how things are going to work.
I'm starting with wrappers and slowly going to work into fixing up the entities and such.
I need to set up a benchmarking program to see where the DLL spends most of it's time
and concentrate on that first.
